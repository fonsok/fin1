# Class vs Struct Usage Analysis

## Executive Summary

Overall, the codebase follows **correct Swift best practices** for class vs struct usage. However, there are opportunities to improve by marking more classes as `final` when inheritance is not needed.

## ✅ Correct Usage Patterns

### 1. **Models (Data Types) - Structs** ✅
All data models correctly use `struct`:
- `Invoice: struct` ✅
- `Document: struct` ✅
- `Order: struct` ✅
- `Trade: struct` ✅
- `Investment: struct` ✅
- `User: struct` ✅

**Reason**: Value semantics are appropriate for data models. They should be copied, not shared by reference.

### 2. **ViewModels - Classes with ObservableObject** ✅
All ViewModels correctly use `class` with `ObservableObject`:
- `InvoiceViewModel: final class` ✅ (marked final)
- `AuthenticationViewModel: class` ⚠️ (should be final)
- `TradesOverviewViewModel: class` ⚠️ (should be final)
- `BuyOrderViewModel: class` ⚠️ (should be final)

**Reason**: `ObservableObject` requires reference types (classes). SwiftUI needs to observe the same instance across view updates.

### 3. **Services - Classes** ✅
Services correctly use `class`:
- `CashBalanceService: class` ⚠️ (should be final)
- `TransactionIdService: class` ⚠️ (should be final)
- `SecuritiesSearchService: class` ✅

**Reason**: Services typically need reference semantics and may need to maintain state or be injected as shared instances.

### 4. **Coordinators - Classes** ✅
Coordinators correctly use `class`:
- `ServiceLifecycleCoordinator: class` ⚠️ (should be final)
- `RoleBasedTabCoordinator: class` ⚠️ (should be final)
- `PaginationCoordinator: class` ⚠️ (should be final)
- `SecuritiesSearchCoordinator: class` ⚠️ (should be final)

**Reason**: Coordinators manage state and need reference semantics.

### 5. **Repositories - Classes with ObservableObject** ✅
- `SavedSecuritiesFiltersRepository: class` ⚠️ (should be final)

**Reason**: Repository needs `ObservableObject` for SwiftUI observation, requires class.

### 6. **Utility Services - Structs** ✅
- `UserValidationService: struct` ✅ (static methods only)

**Reason**: Stateless utility with static methods - perfect use case for struct.

### 7. **Container Types - Structs** ✅
- `AppServices: struct` ✅

**Reason**: Value type container for dependency injection - appropriate for struct.

## ⚠️ Potential Improvements

### Classes That Should Be `final`

In Swift, if a class doesn't need inheritance, it should be marked `final` for:
1. **Performance**: Compiler can optimize method dispatch
2. **Clarity**: Explicitly communicates "no subclassing intended"
3. **Safety**: Prevents accidental subclassing

#### ViewModels (Should be final)
```swift
// ⚠️ CURRENT
class AuthenticationViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }
class TradesOverviewViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }
class DashboardViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }
class InvestorDiscoveryViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }
class SecuritiesSearchViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }
class TraderDepotViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }

// ✅ RECOMMENDED
final class AuthenticationViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }
final class TradesOverviewViewModel: ObservableObject { ... }
// BuyOrderViewModel: bereits final (Extensions +Types, +Bindings, +Investment, +Placement, …)
```

#### Services (Should be final)
```swift
// ⚠️ CURRENT
class CashBalanceService: CashBalanceServiceProtocol, ObservableObject { ... }
class TransactionIdService: TransactionIdServiceProtocol { ... }
class SecuritiesSearchService: SecuritiesSearchServiceProtocol { ... }

// ✅ RECOMMENDED
final class CashBalanceService: CashBalanceServiceProtocol, ObservableObject { ... }
final class TransactionIdService: TransactionIdServiceProtocol { ... }
final class SecuritiesSearchService: SecuritiesSearchServiceProtocol { ... }
```

#### Coordinators (Should be final)
```swift
// ⚠️ CURRENT
class ServiceLifecycleCoordinator: ObservableObject { ... }
class RoleBasedTabCoordinator: ObservableObject { ... }
class PaginationCoordinator<T: Identifiable>: ObservableObject { ... }
class SecuritiesSearchCoordinator: SecuritiesSearchCoordinatorProtocol { ... }

// ✅ RECOMMENDED
final class ServiceLifecycleCoordinator: ObservableObject { ... }
final class RoleBasedTabCoordinator: ObservableObject { ... }
final class PaginationCoordinator<T: Identifiable>: ObservableObject { ... }
final class SecuritiesSearchCoordinator: SecuritiesSearchCoordinatorProtocol { ... }
```

#### Repositories (Should be final)
```swift
// ⚠️ CURRENT
class SavedSecuritiesFiltersRepository: ObservableObject { ... }

// ✅ RECOMMENDED
final class SavedSecuritiesFiltersRepository: ObservableObject { ... }
```

## ✅ Already Correct

These classes are already marked `final`:
- `BuyOrderViewModel: final class` ✅ (SSOT Kauf-Order; Legacy `NewBuyOrderViewModel` / `SimplifiedBuyOrderViewModel` entfernt 2026-06)
- `InvoiceViewModel: final class` ✅
- `TradingStateStore: final class` ✅
- `InvestmentDetailViewModel: final class` ✅
- `InvestmentFormViewModel: final class` ✅
- `InvestmentSummaryViewModel: final class` ✅
- `SearchResultCardViewModel: final class` ✅
- `TradeStatementViewModel: final class` ✅
- `TradeDetailsViewModel: final class` ✅
- `SellOrderViewModel: final class` ✅
- `EventBus: final class` ✅

## 📊 Summary Statistics

### Current State
- **Models**: 100% structs ✅
- **ViewModels**: ~40% marked `final`, ~60% should be `final` ⚠️
- **Services**: ~0% marked `final`, most should be `final` ⚠️
- **Coordinators**: ~0% marked `final`, all should be `final` ⚠️
- **Repositories**: ~0% marked `final`, should be `final` ⚠️

### Best Practices Compliance

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Models as structs | ✅ 100% | Perfect |
| ViewModels as classes | ✅ 100% | Required for ObservableObject |
| Services as classes | ✅ 100% | Appropriate for reference semantics |
| Final keyword usage | ⚠️ ~30% | Should be ~90%+ |

## 🎯 Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Mark all ViewModels as `final`** (unless specifically designed for inheritance)
2. **Mark all Services as `final`** (unless part of a class hierarchy)
3. **Mark all Coordinators as `final`** (coordinators rarely need inheritance)

### Medium Priority
4. **Mark Repositories as `final`** (unless designed for inheritance)
5. **Review any remaining non-final classes** for inheritance needs

### Low Priority
6. **Consider structs for stateless utility services** (like `UserValidationService`)

## Swift Best Practices Reference

### General Swift Principles
- **Prefer structs by default** for most data models and value types
- **Use classes** when you need reference semantics, shared mutable state, or inheritance
- **Structs are value types**: Copied on assignment, each variable has its own independent copy
- **Classes are reference types**: Shared references, changes affect all references
- **Structs are safer and more performant** in many cases due to value semantics
- Swift standard library types (String, Array, Dictionary) are structs

### When to Use Structs
- ✅ Data models (Invoice, Order, Trade, Investment, User, Document, etc.)
- ✅ Value types that should be copied
- ✅ Stateless utilities with static methods
- ✅ Container types (AppServices)
- ✅ Configuration objects
- ✅ Simple data containers

### When to Use Classes
- ✅ **ObservableObject** (ViewModels, Repositories) - **REQUIRED in SwiftUI**
- ✅ Services that maintain state
- ✅ Services that need to be injected as shared instances
- ✅ Coordinators that manage lifecycle
- ✅ When you need reference semantics
- ✅ When you need identity (===)
- ✅ When you need shared mutable state
- ✅ When you need polymorphism via inheritance

### SwiftUI/MVVM-Specific Requirements

**CRITICAL**: In SwiftUI, `ObservableObject` protocol requires reference types (classes). This means:
- ViewModels **MUST** be classes (cannot be structs)
- Any type with `@Published` properties **MUST** be a class with `ObservableObject`
- SwiftUI's observation system needs reference identity to track the same instance across view updates

**Decision Tree:**
1. Need SwiftUI observation (`ObservableObject`, `@Published`)? → **Use `class`** (required)
2. Need reference semantics (shared state, DI, lifecycle)? → **Use `class`** (preferred)
3. Data model or value container? → **Use `struct`** (preferred)
4. Stateless utility (static methods only)? → **Use `struct`** (preferred)
5. Always mark classes as `final` unless inheritance is specifically needed

### When to Use `final`
- ✅ **Always** for classes that don't need inheritance
- ✅ Improves performance (static dispatch)
- ✅ Makes intent clear (no subclassing)
- ✅ Prevents accidental inheritance
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: All ViewModels, Services, Coordinators, and Repositories should be `final` unless specifically designed for inheritance

## Conclusion

The codebase demonstrates **excellent understanding** of when to use classes vs structs. The main improvement opportunity is to mark more classes as `final` for performance and clarity. This is a **low-risk, high-value** refactoring that can be done incrementally.

**Key Takeaways:**
- ✅ Correct fundamental patterns
- ✅ SwiftUI requirements properly followed (ViewModels are classes)
- ⚠️ Could improve with more `final` keywords
- ✅ No critical violations found

**Overall Grade: A-**
